            <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
                    Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be
                    opened, and a private deck.
                </dd>
                <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down
                    quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave,
                    and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink
                    with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
                    located in the lodge.
                </dd>
                <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
                    changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
                    bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
